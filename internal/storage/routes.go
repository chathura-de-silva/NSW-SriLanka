package storage

// The storage API this application mounts. The routes are written out in
// full, like every other route in app.go, rather than assembled from parts;
// TestRoutes checks that each is a valid ServeMux pattern under RoutePrefix,
// that none conflicts with another or with the local content routes, and that
// each routes the requests it should.

	// RoutePrefix is the path the storage API sits under. It is also given to
	// the local backend, so its content routes (RoutePrefix/{key}/content, for
	// the upload and download URLs it signs) sit beside the routes below
	// rather than wherever core/storage's default puts them. core/storage
	// validates it when the driver is built.
