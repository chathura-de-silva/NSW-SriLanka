# Single-Window Workflow & Task Template Configuration Guide

This document serves as an exhaustive reference for creating, modifying, and debugging workflows, task templates, JSONForms, and rendering configurations in the NSW (National Single Window) system. Keep this guide as a direct instruction manual for any AI model (Gemini, Claude, Antigravity, etc.) tasked with writing configuration files.

---

## 1. Directory Structure: Folder-as-Task Convention

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These workflow/form artifacts are **not** committed to this application repo. They live in the public repo [OpenNSW/one-trade-artifacts](https://github.com/OpenNSW/one-trade-artifacts) under the `tnsw/` base path (`tnsw/manifest.json` + `tnsw/<agency_code>/…`) and are fetched at startup by the artifact loader (see `artifactLoader` in [`configs/config.example.yaml`](../configs/config.example.yaml)). Every path below is relative to that base path, so `<agency_code>/…` here means `tnsw/<agency_code>/…` in the artifacts repo. To edit them locally, clone that repo and point the local loader at its `tnsw` dir (`artifactLoader.type: local`, `artifactLoader.local.root: <path>/tnsw`).

Task definitions are grouped into self-contained folders representing micro-workflows under an agency-specific folder (e.g. `<agency_code>/`).

> [!NOTE]
> `fcau` (Food Control Administration Unit) is used as the reference example throughout this guide. For each agency process in our NSW system, we will write a similar set of configs (e.g. Coconut Development Authority (`cda`), National Plant Quarantine Service (`npqs`), etc.).

Each task folder is recognized by the `config_loader.go` registry scanner and must conform to the following file layout:

```text
<agency_code>/
├── <agency_code>_workflow.json       # Parent (top-level) workflow definition (e.g. fcau_workflow.json)
└── <task-folder>/                    # E.g. "3-1-warehouse_scheduling/" or "2-payment_app_fee/"
    ├── workflow.json                 # Micro-workflow graph definition (Required)
    ├── render.json                   # UI Zone rendering configuration (Required)
    ├── <role>input.json              # Task definition type & properties (E.g. traderinput.json, officerinput.json)
    ├── <role>input_jsonform.json     # JSONForms schema/uiSchema for interactive forms
    └── [instructions_jsonform.json]  # Optional Markdown template for static instruction boxes
```

---

## 2. Parent Workflow Definition (`<agency_code>_workflow.json`)

The parent workflow coordinates the high-level execution graph across multiple micro-workflows.

### Core Structure

- **Nodes**: List of blocks representing steps.
  - `type`: `START`, `TASK`, `GATEWAY` (split or join), or `END`.
  - `task_template_id`: Matches the `id` declared inside the child subworkflow `workflow.json`.
- **Edges**: Connectivity path mapping.
  - `condition`: String expression for conditional branching (e.g. `fcau.warehouse_inspection_required == true`).

### Critical Mapping Variable Scope Rules (Common Gotchas)

1. **Namespace isolation**: Parent variables live in the agency/process namespace (e.g. `fcau.reference_number`, `fcau.userform`). Child workflows expect local variables, which can be:
   - A **bare variable** (e.g. `reference_number`), or
   - A **nested variable** (e.g. `userform` can contain all the fields in the userform as a JSON object, and you can access them using dot notation).
2. **Initial Task Outputs**: The first assessment task (usually `fcau_1_0_apply`) must capture critical workflow state like `reference_number` and the user form object:

   ```json
   "output_mapping": {
     "reviewerform.reference_number": "fcau.reference_number",
     "userform": "fcau.userform",
     "reviewerform.application_review_outcome": "fcau.application_review_outcome"
   }
   ```

3. **Subworkflow Inputs**: All subsequent tasks (`type: TASK`) in the parent workflow **must** pass down these states via `input_mapping`. Leaving this empty will cause the child tasks to fail execution:

   ```json
   "input_mapping": {
     "fcau.reference_number": "reference_number",
     "fcau.userform": "userform"
   }
   ```

4. **Cross-Subworkflow / Inter-Task Variable Propagation**:
   - Subworkflows run in completely isolated execution contexts. They ONLY have access to variables mapped into them in the parent workflow's task node `input_mapping`.
   - If a subworkflow (e.g., `npqs-review-treatment-certs`) needs to access data produced in a previous subworkflow (e.g., `traderinput` from `npqs-upload-treatment-certs`), this data **must** be explicitly propagated:
     1. The producing subworkflow must return the variable in its outputs (e.g., `"traderinput"`).
     2. The parent workflow task node must map this output back to a parent global variable:

        ```json
        "output_mapping": {
          "traderinput": "npqs.treatment_traderinput"
        }
        ```

     3. The parent workflow task node invoking the subsequent subworkflow must map that parent variable to the child's input variable:

        ```json
        "input_mapping": {
          "npqs.treatment_traderinput": "traderinput"
        }
        ```

     Without this chain of input/output mappings, the child workflow interpreter will fail with an error like `input mapping error: required global variable 'traderinput' not found in workflow variables`.

---

## 3. Subworkflow Definitions (`workflow.json`)

The child subworkflow defines the execution path of a single transaction stage.

```json
{
  "id": "fcau-pay-app-fee-flow",
  "name": "Pay Application Fee",
  "version": 1,
  "nodes": [
    { "id": "start", "type": "START" },
    {
      "id": "pay_app_fee_task",
      "type": "TASK",
      "task_template_id": "fcau-pay-app-fee--payment",
      "input_mapping": {
        "reference_number": "reference_number"
      },
      "output_mapping": {
        "payment_status": "payment_status"
      }
    },
    { "id": "end", "type": "END" }
  ],
  "edges": [ ... ]
}
```

---

## 4. UI Rendering Configuration (`render.json`)

`render.json` instructs the trader-app (or officer-app) frontend how to lay out the workspace zones, what blueprints to load, and which interactions are legal.

### Schema Fields

- `id`: Unique identifier, conventionally `<subworkflow-id>:render` (e.g. `fcau-warehouse-scheduling-flow:render`).
- `type`: A user-facing category for the view. `APPLICATION` (trader/applicant submission view) and `REVIEW` (officer review split pane) are the common ones; the shipped configs also use `PAYMENT`, `SYSTEM`, `LAB_TEST`, `SAMPLE_COLLECTION`, `VISUAL_ASSESSMENT`, and `CERTIFICATE_ISSUANCE`.
- `title`: Human-readable name for the whole task view (e.g. `[Trade] Select HS Codes`).
- `read`: **Who may read this task at all** — see [Read authorization](#read-authorization) below.
- `sections`: Map of slots (e.g. `user_form`, `status_messsage`). The slot key is the section's identifier: it is sent to the frontend as the `id` of the section's view entry, and `layouts` refer to sections by it. Sections have no `id` field of their own.
  - `templateId`: Identifies the schema file to display (maps to `id` in the respective `*_jsonform.json`).
  - `projector`: `FORM` (interactive JSONForm), `MARKDOWN` (static instructions), or `PAYMENT` (checkout page).
  - `dataKey`: Variable name matching the task's output namespace (e.g. `traderinput`, `reviewerform`). Omit it to hand the projector the whole variable map.
  - `title`: Heading rendered above the section. Optional; a section without one renders with no heading.
  - `visibleWhen`: Declarative rules deciding whether the section renders at all. All rules present must hold (they AND together); omitting the block renders the section always. There is no `OR` — express alternatives as separate slots.
    - `states`: List of task states the section shows in, matched case-insensitively (e.g. `["PENDING_USER"]`).
    - `requireDataKey`: Section only renders if this **top-level** key exists and is non-null in the task's data. Not a dotted path.
    - `requireClaim`: Section only renders if the caller holds this claim — see [Read authorization](#read-authorization).
  - `handles`: **CRITICAL FOR EDITABILITY**. Defines what actions/buttons can be clicked on the form zone. **If `handles` is missing or empty, the frontend renders the form fields as read-only (non-interactive).** A handle only reaches the frontend if its section rendered _and_ its `command` is legal in the current state, so hiding a section also removes its buttons.
    - `messages`: Optional. What to tell the trader after clicking this button, keyed by the task state the click leads to — see [Post-action messages](#post-action-messages).
- `layouts`: Named orderings of the sections (e.g. `"layout_1": ["feedback", "user_form"]`). Each layout lists **all** section keys and expresses relative order only, never visibility. visibility stays with each section's `visibleWhen`. States that agree on the relative order of the sections they show can share one layout.
- `states`: Defines the operational lifecycle.
  - `PENDING_USER`: Active state where user can perform actions.
    - `actions`: List of allowed commands (e.g. `{ "command": "submit" }`).
    - `order`: Which layout to render this state in, as `{ "$ref": "#/layouts/<name>" }`.

### Post-action messages

Submitting a step is asynchronous: the request only records the data and wakes the workflow. The task is `ADVANCING` from then on, and takes the next step's state when that step starts. So the trader-app waits 1.5 seconds after a click, fetches the task again, and shows the clicked button's `messages` entry for the state it finds, as a toast. No entry for that state shows nothing, and so does a next step that takes longer than the wait.

Each entry is `{ "text": "...", "variant": "..." }`. `variant` is one of `success`, `info`, `warning` or `error`, and is `success` when left out:

- `success`: it worked.
- `info`: it was accepted, but the result isn't known yet.
- `warning`: it worked, but the trader has to do something.
- `error`: it failed.

```json
"handles": [
  { "command": "save_as_draft", "label": "Save as Draft", "element": "secondary_action",
    "messages": { "PENDING_USER": { "text": "Draft saved.", "variant": "success" } } },
  { "command": "submit", "label": "Submit Application", "element": "primary_action",
    "messages": { "QUEUED_EXTERNALLY": { "text": "Application sent to NPQS for review.", "variant": "success" } } }
]
```

When writing them:

- **One message per state.** If a button can end in the same state for different reasons (the SLPA gate pass button both issues a gate pass and deletes a consolidation, and either completes the task), write one message that is true for all of them.
- **A key matches only once the next step has started.** A key equal to the state the button was clicked in, such as `PENDING_USER` for Save as Draft, matches when the click comes back to that state, not before: the task is `ADVANCING` in between. A step still running when the task is fetched again is `ADVANCING` or `STARTING_STEP`, so a key of `ADVANCING` matches it. Give that one neutral wording and `info` ("Verification requested."), since the outcome isn't known yet.

### Section order

The task view reaches the frontend as an **ordered list**, and the frontend renders it as-is. The order is:

1. The current state's layout, filtered down to the sections visible right now.
2. Then any visible section the layout doesn't list, sorted by key.
3. Any malformed/additional keys in the layout are ignored, and any section key not present in the `sections` block is ignored.

A state with no `order` therefore renders its visible sections sorted alphabetically by key. Declare a layout whenever that isn't the order you want (e.g. `status_awaiting` sorts after `review_history`).

```json
{
  "id": "cda-apply-coconut-cert-flow:render",
  "sections": {
    "feedback": {
      "templateId": "cda-apply-coconut-cert--feedback",
      "title": "Officer Feedback & Deficiencies",
      "projector": "MARKDOWN",
      "dataKey": "rejection_reason",
      "visibleWhen": { "states": ["PENDING_USER"], "requireDataKey": "rejection_reason" }
    },
    "user_form": {
      "templateId": "cda-apply-coconut-cert--user-form",
      "title": "CDA Export Coconut Certificate Application",
      "projector": "FORM",
      "dataKey": "userform",
      "handles": [
        { "command": "submit", "label": "Submit Application", "element": "primary_action" }
      ]
    }
  },
  "layouts": {
    "layout_1": ["feedback", "user_form"]
  },
  "states": {
    "PENDING_USER": {
      "order": { "$ref": "#/layouts/layout_1" },
      "actions": [{ "command": "submit" }]
    },
    "COMPLETED": { "order": { "$ref": "#/layouts/layout_1" } }
  }
}
```

In `PENDING_USER` the feedback (when present) renders above the form; in `COMPLETED` the same layout applies and the feedback is simply not visible.

### Read authorization

`GET /api/v1/tasks/{id}` is scoped to the caller. Before rendering, the backend resolves one **claim** per role in `configs/catalog.json`, named `role:<logicalName>` — so `role:trader` and `role:cha` today. A claim is true only when the caller both holds that role in their token **and** their company owns the task's consignment in that same slot; holding the role is not enough.

Two levers use those claims:

- **`read.roles`** (top level) lists the logical roles allowed to read the task at all. A caller eligible for none of them gets a `404` — deliberately indistinguishable from a task that does not exist. Omit the block (or leave the list empty) to admit any role that owns the consignment.
- **`visibleWhen.requireClaim`** (per section) gates one section on one claim, which is how a single task state shows different content to different roles.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **`read.roles` is ordered, and the order is precedence.** One user can be eligible for several roles at once — a self-clearing operator holding both Trader and CHA at a company that is both the trader and the CHA on its own consignment. Since `visibleWhen` rules only ever AND, two true claims would render two contradictory sections side by side ("here is the form" next to "waiting for your CHA"). So when `read.roles` is declared, the caller **acts as the first role in the list they are eligible for**, and exactly one `role:*` claim is true.
>
> Put the role that _acts_ on the task first: `["cha", "trader"]` for a step the CHA performs, `["trader", "cha"]` for one the trader performs. Reordering the list changes which screen a dual-role user gets.
>
> A config that declares **no** `read.roles` has expressed no precedence, so every eligible role's claim is reported. That is safe only because such a config has no per-role sections to disagree — **if you use `requireClaim` anywhere, declare `read.roles`.**

```json
{
  "id": "trade-hscode-selection-flow:render",
  "type": "APPLICATION",
  "read": { "roles": ["cha", "trader"] },
  "sections": {
    "status_message": {
      "templateId": "trade-hscode-selection--waiting-markdown",
      "projector": "MARKDOWN",
      "visibleWhen": { "states": ["PENDING_USER"], "requireClaim": "role:trader" }
    },
    "workspace": {
      "templateId": "trade-hscode-selection--form",
      "projector": "FORM",
      "dataKey": "traderinput",
      "visibleWhen": { "states": ["PENDING_USER"], "requireClaim": "role:cha" },
      "handles": [{ "command": "submit", "label": "Complete Selection", "element": "primary_action" }]
    }
  },
  "states": { "PENDING_USER": { "actions": [{ "command": "submit" }] } }
}
```

In the same `PENDING_USER` state the CHA gets the form and its submit button, while the trader gets only a waiting notice. A section with no `requireClaim` is visible to whichever role the caller is acting as — which is how both roles share one completed-summary section.

> [!WARNING]
> Claim names are matched **exactly and case-sensitively**, and a `requireClaim` naming a claim the backend does not produce fails the whole request with a `500` rather than silently hiding the section. Only use names of the form `role:<key>` where `<key>` is a role in `configs/catalog.json`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is presentation-layer scoping and the read gate — it does not authorize _writes_. Who may run a command is a separate, deny-by-default rule in the subtask template's `authz` extension (see [`internal/tasks/extensions/authz/README.md`](../internal/tasks/extensions/authz/README.md)). A section hidden here still needs its command denied there.

### Interactive Form Template Example (`render.json`)

```json
{
  "id": "fcau-warehouse-scheduling-flow:render",
  "type": "APPLICATION",
  "sections": {
    "workspace": {
      "templateId": "fcau-warehouse-scheduling--form",
      "title": "Warehouse Inspection Scheduling",
      "projector": "FORM",
      "dataKey": "traderinput",
      "handles": [
        {
          "command": "submit",
          "label": "Schedule Inspection",
          "element": "primary_action"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "states": {
    "PENDING_USER": {
      "actions": [
        {
          "command": "submit"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## 5. Forms Config and Schemas

### Task Types Configuration (`traderinput.json` / `officerinput.json`)

Declares if the task is completed by the applicant (`USER_INPUT`) or another agency (`EXTERNAL_REVIEW`), and sets up callback routes:

```json
{
  "id": "fcau-warehouse-inspection--officer-review",
  "task_type": "EXTERNAL_REVIEW",
  "output_namespace": "reviewerform",
  "plugin_properties": {
    "service_id": "fcau",
    "path": "/api/v1/inject",
    "task_code": "fcau_warehouse_inspection_v1"
  }
}
```

An `EXTERNAL_REVIEW` step sends `{taskCode, taskId, callbackToken, consignmentId, serviceUrl, data}` in a POST to the service's `path` and parks in `QUEUED_EXTERNALLY`. The reviewer calls back on `POST {serviceUrl}/{callbackToken}` (`/api/v1/callbacks/{token}`) with `{"command": "...", "payload": {...}}`. The token is opaque: it names this one step, so a callback that arrives after the task has moved on gets `409` instead of completing a later step, and it is also the key the reviewer uses to recognize a repeated dispatch. A re-dispatch of the same task (e.g. after an amendment) carries a new token.

### Reference IDs (`REFID_GENERATOR`)

Fills fields of a copy of the step's inputs with reference IDs, and writes the filled copy to `<output_namespace>`. The formats are defined in the `refid` section of `configs/config.yaml` (see `configs/config.example.yaml`). The step is synchronous. It reads only its inputs, which come through `input_mapping`, and writes only its own namespace.

Each entry in `plugin_properties.ids` names a field to fill and the format to generate it from. Entries may use the same format or different ones. In the example below, an order gets one reference, and every line in it a number of its own, counted per warehouse:

```json
{
  "id": "acme-order--refid",
  "task_type": "REFID_GENERATOR",
  "output_namespace": "refid",
  "plugin_properties": {
    "ids": [
      { "path": "/order/order_ref", "issuer": "ACME", "id_type": "order" },
      { "each": "/order/lines", "path": "0/line_no", "issuer": "ACME", "id_type": "order_line",
        "params": { "warehouse": "0/warehouse_code", "region": "/order/region" } }
    ]
  }
}
```

The task workflow node passes the order in and takes it back out: `"input_mapping": {"order": "order"}`, `"output_mapping": {"refid.order": "order"}`. Any later node that maps `order` sees the IDs.

**Pointers:**

- **Absolute:** a pointer starting with `/` is a [JSON Pointer](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6901) from the root of the inputs.
- **Relative:** a pointer starting with `0/` is a [Relative JSON Pointer](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-bhutton-relative-json-pointer) from the current element. It's only allowed in an entry with `each`. Only `0/` is supported.

| Field       | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `path`      | The field to fill. Without `each` it is absolute. With `each` it must be relative, so each element gets its own ID. Two paths in the same scope (the root, or one `each` array) can't overlap: neither may sit inside the other.        |
| `each`      | Optional. An absolute pointer to an array of objects; the entry applies to every element. A missing or `null` array has nothing to fill.                                                                                                |
| `params`    | Optional. Maps each param the format expects (a list segment's `param`, or a `{name}` in a scope key) to a pointer to its value. A pointer with no value leaves that param out. Params are read before any ID of the step is generated. |
| `overwrite` | Optional, default `false`. When `true`, the field is generated on every run, even if it already holds a value.                                                                                                                          |

**Behaviour:**

- **Single ID:** use one entry, e.g. `{"path": "/reference_id", ...}`. The node maps it on with `"output_mapping": {"refid.reference_id": "reference_id"}`. It reaches the parent workflow only through the parent TASK node's own `output_mapping`.
- **Order:** entries are filled in the order listed, and elements in index order.
- **Existing values are kept:** a field that already holds an ID keeps it. A resubmission that loops back through the step numbers only the fields that have none yet, such as a newly added line.
- **`overwrite`:** use it for an ID that must always come from the system. Every run then takes new numbers, and with `each` every element is renumbered, so don't use it for an ID another system has already seen. `readOnly` is only enforced by the form, so without `overwrite` a value sent straight to the API is kept.
- **Shape errors fail first:** the step fails before any number is used if:
  - a field to fill holds a non-string value (`null` counts as empty);
  - `each` isn't an array, or an element isn't an object;
  - a path runs through a non-object;
  - a param's value isn't a string.
- **Retries:** a Temporal retry of the step sees the same inputs and issues new numbers, so a sequence can have gaps. Nothing downstream has used the earlier ones.
- **Not configured:** if the deployment has no `refid.issuers`, the step fails.
- **Showing the IDs:** the step doesn't write the namespace a user's own form reads, e.g. the one its `USER_INPUT` step fills. So a form section reading that namespace shows the IDs only once a later step maps them back in. To show them straight away, add a `MARKDOWN` section with `"dataKey": "refid"`.

### JSONForm Schemas (`*_jsonform.json`)

Follows standard [JSONForms](https://jsonforms.io/) schemas with a `schema` and `uiSchema` block:

```json
{
  "id": "fcau-warehouse-scheduling--form",
  "title": "Schedule Warehouse Inspection",
  "schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "inspection_date": { "type": "string", "format": "date", "title": "Preferred Date" }
    },
    "required": [ "inspection_date" ]
  },
  "uiSchema": {
    "type": "VerticalLayout",
    "elements": [
      { "type": "Control", "scope": "#/properties/inspection_date" }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 6. Development Workflow & Hot-Reloading

1. **Parent Workflow Hot-Reload**:
   - The parent workflow file `fcau_workflow.json` is read from disk on every new consignment initialization. Modifying this file does **not** require a server restart.
2. **Form schemas and markdown templates**:
   - `*_jsonform.json` and markdown templates are fetched through the artifact loader on **every render**, so edits show up on the next request with no restart (with `artifactLoader.type: local`).
3. **Render configs**:
   - `render.json` is **snapshotted into `task_records_v2.render_config` when the task starts**, not read per request. Editing one therefore affects **newly created tasks only** — existing tasks keep the blob they were created with. To see a render-config change, start a **fresh consignment**.
4. **The manifest**:
   - `manifest.json` is read once at startup. Adding a new template file means adding its row there **and** restarting the server.
