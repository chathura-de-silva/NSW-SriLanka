// Package integrations gathers what the deployment owes the systems NSW talks

//
// Most of an integration's configuration is not here: the outbound calls are
// described in the services registry (see configs/services*.json), which the
// remote manager reads on its own. What is left is everything else a partner
// system needs from a deployment — the secret SLPA signs its callbacks with,
// today — and it lives beside the integrations rather than in the server's
// configuration package, so an integration states its own requirements and the
// server only says where the values come from.
//
// A new integration adds a field here and validates itself; nothing in cmd/
// needs to learn what it requires.
