// stepID is the parked step's active_step_id, read in the same lookup that found
// the task, so the completion is for the step that was parked when the event
// was matched; if the task has moved on since, core rejects it as stale.
//
// That is why an event which does not end a lifecycle still completes the step:
// the workflow's own gateway sends it back to the same wait, so what the trader
// sees is updated and the step is open again. See the SLPA task workflows.

// should stop), and an order mid-transition (its retry will land).
//
// Every answer is about this wait alone. A consignment carries the same order
// identifiers on more than one task — the approval and the invoice both hold
// the slug — so a redelivered approval must not be judged by whether the
// invoice task that followed it happens to be open.
