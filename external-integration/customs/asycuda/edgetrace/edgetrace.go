// Package edgetrace records the exchange with SLC Edge in full: what was sent,
// what came back, and the callbacks they push afterwards.
//
// Everything here is DEBUG, and deliberately so. These payloads are the
// trader's declaration — names, addresses, invoice values, container numbers —
// which is not something to accumulate in the log of a running deployment. It
// is also the only thing that answers the first question asked of any
// integration defect: what exactly did we send them, and what did they say.
//
// So it is a switch rather than a default. Turn it on for as long as the
// question takes to answer:
//
//	server:
//	  logLevel: debug   # in config.yaml
//
// Each function checks the level before doing any work, so nothing is
// marshalled while the switch is off.
